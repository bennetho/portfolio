            My name is Benneth Ossai, A front-end developer. I'm currently
            living in Portimao, PT ðŸŒ´. i'm curious of learning new things so i
            spent most of my time experimenting new things that will improve my
            skills as a front-end developer,I like to build new projects and
            also share what I've learned as a developer to other people. Outside
            of coding I enjoy sports and listening to musics.
